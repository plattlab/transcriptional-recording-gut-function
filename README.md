# transcriptional-recording-gut-function
This repository contains code and notebooks linked to the manuscript ["Noninvasive assessment of gut function using transcriptional recording sentinel cells"](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm6038)

It builds upon the pipeline described in our <em>Nature Protocols</em> [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-019-0253-4) and its associated [git repo](https://github.com/plattlab/Transcriptional-Recording).

The raw sequencing data for this project are available here: Bioproject [PRJNA807096](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA807096) and SRA [SRP364805](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP364805). 


The workflow is `primary-analysis` &rarr; `secondary-analysis`

Details on each of these are in the respective folders.
